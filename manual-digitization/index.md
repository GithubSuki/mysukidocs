* **Markdown can be used for everything**. *People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.*

* **Markdown is portable**. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. 

* **Markdown is platform independent**. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.

* **Markdown is future proof**. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. 

* **Markdown is everywhere. Websites** like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.
